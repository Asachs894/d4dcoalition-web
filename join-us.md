The Design 4 Democracy Coalition is a growing group of democracy and human rights organizations committed to ensuring that the technology industry embraces democracy as a core design principle. We come from diverse regions, political ideologies and backgrounds but are united in our conviction that technology platforms should help build a more just and democratic world. 

If you or your organization is interested or active on these issues and believes that the Coalition can amplify or support your efforts, please let us know by clicking [here][here].
