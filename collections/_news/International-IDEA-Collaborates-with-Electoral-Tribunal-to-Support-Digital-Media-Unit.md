D4D network partner International IDEA has entered into a collaboration with the Electoral Tribunal of Panama in order to provide support to the newly created Digital Media Unit. The unit's mandate is twofold. On one side, it is in charge of the online communication of the Tribunal in terms of Electoral information, providing a key line of information to the population through Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp with the key electoral information. On the other, the Digital Media Unit is spearheading the fight against disinformation, with a 24/7 monitoring of social media war room, supporting the Tribunal to detect electoral offenses, campaigns to raise awareness around the dangers of spreading disinformation and engagement with diverse stakeholders to protect the electoral integrity. The Unit has also been in charge of launching the countryâ€™s first Digital Ethics Pact, encouraging the population to make responsible use of social media during the electoral campaign. International IDEA support will continue until the elections in May 2019 and beyond, aiming to position the Unit as the leader in the fight against disinformation in Panama.
