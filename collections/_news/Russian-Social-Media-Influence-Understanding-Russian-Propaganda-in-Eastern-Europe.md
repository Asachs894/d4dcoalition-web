The RAND Corporation released a [report that explores the threat of Russian-language social media activity to former Soviet states][link]. Employing interviews with experts in security and regional politics, as well as analysis of social media data, this report digs into the Kremlinâ€™s use of shared post-Soviet experiences to spread disinformation. The report offers recommendations including better tracking of Russian media, increasing media literacy, and improving reliable content to offer an alternative to the Kremlin agenda.
