NDI has recently published a new guidance document on [Disinformation and Electoral Integrity for NDI Elections Programs.][link] The document outlines NDI's programmatic approaches to addressing disinformation in the electoral context, particularly the actions citizen election observers and international observers can take to mitigate, expose, and counter disinformation. It also stresses the importance of using open election data to deter disinformation and advocacy around norms and standards to counter disinformation.
