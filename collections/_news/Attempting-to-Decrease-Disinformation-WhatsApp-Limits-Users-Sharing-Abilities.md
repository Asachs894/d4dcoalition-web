In response to a rise in violence fueled by disinformation on WhatsApp, the company made the [decision to limit the number of times a user can forward a message][link] to 20 around the world and five in India. India was home to the highest number of forwarded photos, messages and videos, resulting in over 24 murders by violent mobs which had been incited on the app. After an initial success with the new cap in India, WhatsApp decided to extend this limit to all of its global users. The company hopes that this change will refocus users on the app’s original purpose: communication with close contacts.
