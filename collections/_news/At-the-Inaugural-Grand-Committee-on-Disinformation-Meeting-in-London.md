At the [Inaugural Grand Committee on Disinformation][link], an empty chair was left for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who turned down invitations to testify before the international committee of lawmakers. In his place, Facebook Vice President Richard Allan faced hard-hitting questions about email communication found within documents seized by the UK parliament and Facebook’s role in global democracy challenges. At the close of the hearing, members of parliament from around the world signed a declaration of [‘Principles of the Law Governing the Internet.’][link2] Simultaneously, MP Damian Collins, Chair of the UK parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, pressured, under threat of imprisonment, the founder of the social media application developer Six4Three to [hand over internal Facebook documents][link3] and emails, which have now been released by the committee and demonstrate its policy development, strategy and internal deliberations over data sharing with third-party developers, among other issues.
