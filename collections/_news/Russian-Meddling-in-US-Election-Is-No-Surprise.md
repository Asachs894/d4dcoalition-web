A [three-part New York Times documentary series][link] explores Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election in the context of the wider Russian effort to divide the West. From the inception of Soviet fake news to its use today, the NYT uncovers the continuation of Russian interference in the United States and the reasons why the U.S. government and other nations are so woefully unprepared to counter this disinformation campaign.
