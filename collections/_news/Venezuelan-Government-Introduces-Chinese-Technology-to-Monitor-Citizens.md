First seen in China, [Venezuela has adopted an RFID smart card system][link] that allows the government to track citizen behavior. This Fatherland Card, made by Chinese telecom giant ZTE Corp, collects information including healthcare data, voting participation, and subsidized food distribution in a central database. In a country where many citizens rely on government programs to feed their families and receive medical care, opponents are calling the government's requirement that citizens obtain the Fatherland card to access services akin to blackmail.
