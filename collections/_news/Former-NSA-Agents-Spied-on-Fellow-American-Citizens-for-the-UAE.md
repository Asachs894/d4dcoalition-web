Reuters [has accused an intelligence network][link] called Project Raven of working for and out-of the United Arab Emirates by spying on the perceived enemies of that state's government, including American citizens. The cybersecurity company hired by Abu Dhabi to conduct the espionage, called CyberPoint, is an American group and employees many former National Security Agency employees. While in 2016 Project Raven shifted to the control of an Emirati cyber company, Dark Matter, a good number of the American employees remained with the team. Though interviewees stated that some of the main targets of Project Raven were violent extremist groups like the Islamic State, several other targets included journalists, human-rights campaigners and other dissidents of the UAE government; Project Raven began in 2009.
