A bipartisan group of U.S. Senators led by Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) [have written a letter to U.S. Secretary of State][link] Mike Pompeo asking for an investigation into “CCP attempts to erode democratic processes and norms around the world threaten U.S. partnerships and prosperity,” particularly in regards to Taiwan.  They suggest that organized social media campaigns targeted the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), its candidates and President Tsai Ing-wen [during local elections in November][link2]. Observers in Taiwan and elsewhere have said that the Chinese government supported these opposition campaigns with different forms of computational propaganda, and the Senators' letter suggested they find the allegations credible and want them investigated.
