Responding to the threat of misinformation on its platform during electoral cycles in democracies across the world, social media giant Twitter has [announced][link] the introduction of a new reporting mechanism in a company blog post. Through this new reporting mechanism, individual users can report false or misleading information about elections to company administrators, who will then respond accordingly, including removing the reported content. The introduction of this policy comes as Twitter prepares to receive an influx of millions of tweets about the Lok Sabha elections in India and the continent-wide European Parliamentary election.
