NDI and partners met at a forum on “Representation in the Age of Populism? Ideas for Global Action,” sponsored by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA) at the Belgian Senate from June 18-20. NDI organized workshops focused on developing responses to disinformation, the negative and positive roles technology can play in strengthening democratic values, and examining more broadly the concept of information integrity during a rise of populism. Margo Gontar, Design 4 Democracy Advisory Board member, spoke on her work as the co-founder of StopFake.org in Ukraine, which has developed novel means of combating disinformation and computational propaganda, largely emanating from Russia, within the context of civil and information warfare. She was joined by Raegan MacDonald, a Senior Advisor on Public Policy for the EU and Member of the European Commission’s High Level Expert Group on Disinformation, along with representatives from Facebook and the EU’s East Stratcom Task Force on Disinformation. They discussed a range of issues facing policymakers, companies and civil society in the new information spaces opening up online, and potential multistakeholder solutions to these complex problems going forward.
