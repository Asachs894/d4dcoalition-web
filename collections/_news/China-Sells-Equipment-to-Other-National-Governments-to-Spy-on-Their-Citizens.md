China has developed an extensive system of surveillance for both domestic use and, as of late, [export to other autocratic regimes][link] as well. The system, called ECU-911, has been used by both domestic Chinese law enforcement authorities, as well as the intelligence agencies of countries like Ecuador, which purchases the system from China. The system is an interconnected set of thousands of cameras that has been billed as a way to prevent violent crime throughout a given country, but has been accused by rights activists as a way for national governments to spy on their citizens.
