SCL Elections, the [parent company of Cambridge Analytica, was fined Â£15,000][/link] after it failed to comply with a UK Information Commissioner Office (ICO) order to release the personal data of an American citizen. The man, David Carroll, filed a request for the company to release all information that was collected about him, however SCL Elections released basic information and did not respond to requests for further data, prompting Mr. Carroll to file a case with the Hendon magistrates court. SCL Elections pled guilty to failing to comply with an ICO enforcement notice and breaching the Data Protection Act.
