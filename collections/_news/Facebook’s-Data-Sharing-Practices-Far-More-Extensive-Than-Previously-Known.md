Since its early years, [Facebook has entered into data partnerships][link] with other sites and platforms to customize the information presented to users, decrease competition and encourage expansion through a wider user base. These partnerships have incurred concern and condemnation from the international community. Some companies, many of whom said that they were unaware of the wide access given to them by Facebook, were able to access contact information from users and non-users, read and change private messages and view personal information without official audits of their use of this data or their privacy practices.
