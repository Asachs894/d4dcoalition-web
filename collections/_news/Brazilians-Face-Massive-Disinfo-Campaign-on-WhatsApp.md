In a [New York Times op-ed][link], researchers and fact checkers in Brazil called on WhatsApp to make changes to its system when they found that it was being widely used to spread disinformation in the runup to the national election. A poll found that 44 percent of Brazilians use WhatsApp to read political news, and a growing amount of misinformation and disinformation has been shared widely through the app, and the writers called on the company to restrict forwards, broadcasts and limit the size of new groups in Brazil during the election period.
