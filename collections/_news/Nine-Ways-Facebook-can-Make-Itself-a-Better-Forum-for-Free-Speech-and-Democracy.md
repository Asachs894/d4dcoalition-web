Facebook has invited researchers to study some of its inner workings and develop proposals that would improve the company’s work on disinformation, hate speech and democracy. [This report offers nine recommendations][link] for Facebook’s policies, engagement with disinformation and impact on governance, including: clarifying its community standards on hate speech, hiring content reviewers with knowledge of cultural contexts, increasing transparency around the enforcement of policies in complicated cases, and expanding the context and fact-checking information provided for users. The same group also studied [the Impact of Greater News Literacy][link2] in societies as well as the connection between news literacy and other behaviors connected to media consumption online.
