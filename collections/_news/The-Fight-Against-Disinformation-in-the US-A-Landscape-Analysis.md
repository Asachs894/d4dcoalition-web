The Harvard University Shorenstein Center for Media Studies published [The Fight Against Disinformation in the U.S.: A Landscape Analysis][link], which explores the key players, tactics, and support for learning and programmatic responses to viral digital culture. Societal changes impact the way that we use media, but these shifts are in all directions. When the way that people communicate changes, this is reflected in a shift in society as well. The paper discusses the impacts of the changes in media use on American culture and the ways in which some people are trying to combat the negative impact of computational propaganda, disinformation and other harmful forms of content.
