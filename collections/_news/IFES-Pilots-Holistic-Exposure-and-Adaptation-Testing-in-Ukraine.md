D4D coalition member IFES is currently piloting its Holistic Exposure and Adaptation Testing (HEAT) process in Ukraine. The HEAT process is a method for identifying and testing the potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in the use of election data management technology. HEAT tests the technology itself, as well as the legal and operational frameworks in which the technology is being deployed. As part of the pilot, IFES conducted a cybersecurity assessment in summer 2018 and a cybersecurity tabletop simulation with the Ukrainian Central Election Commission in November 2018.
