An independent BSR report, commissioned by Facebook, about the impact of the platform on the human rights crisis in Myanmar found evidence that [Facebook did not take enough action to prevent violence from being spread on its site][link]. Thousands of people have died in the conflict, with hundreds of thousands more displaced internally and into neighboring Bangladesh. The report warns Facebook of future human rights abuses around the 2020 elections and calls for the company to both create a new human rights policy and enforce its current hate speech policies by working with the local authorities.
