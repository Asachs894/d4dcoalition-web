In new research from Harvardâ€™s Berkman Klein Center, Henry Farrell and Bruce Schneier argue that nations [should approach disinformation as they approach other issues of state security][link]. Different vulnerabilities are presents and potential responses are required depending on the type of government structure; autocracy or democracy.

This causes democracies to be more susceptible to narratives about general political organization.
