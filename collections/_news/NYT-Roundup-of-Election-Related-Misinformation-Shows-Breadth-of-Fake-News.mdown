With election day drawing nearer, disinformation efforts to influence voters increase. [The New York Times published a “Roundup”][link] of disinformation-related coverage, its impact on the U.S. midterm elections, and its spread internationally. In response to suspicious pro-Saudi Arabian government tweets, Twitter suspended suspected bots that tweeted and re-tweeted identical talking points including “#unfollow_enemies_of_the_nation.” Twitter also released 11 million tweets believed to be from state-backed information operations originating in Russia and Iran. Facebook pages that appeared to be for Women’s Marches were found to originate in Bangladesh and sought to sell march-related merchandise.
