[Facebook announced the extension of content policies and tools][link] regarding upcoming elections in Nigeria, the European Union, India and Ukraine. The company is planning an ad hoc approach of restrictions on those who can advertise electoral ads before elections in Nigeria and Ukraine, as well as the creation of an online library of electoral ads in India.  Later in January, the social media platform [blocked tools developed by ProPublica][link2] and other media watchdogs, leading to criticism of Facebook from these groups, as well as lawmakers concerned with internet privacy. For over a year and a half, ProPublica, a non-profit investigative news agency, had been compiling information on hundreds of thousands of advertisements appearing on Facebook, detailing the identity of the ads’ sponsors, as well as who the ad might be targeting, with a software tool. In response to Facebook’s blockage, Mozilla Foundation then [penned an open letter][link3] to Facebook condemning the action, which was signed by several e-media freedom groups. After garnering significant negative press from this open letter, facebook VP [Rob Leathrern announced via Twitter][link4] that it would do more to disclose the sourcing of political ads for upcoming polls in the critical upcoming elections.
