Over 50 countries signed on to the [Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace][link], an agreement released by French President Emmanuel Macron as part of the Paris Peace Forum in November. China, Russia, Australia, North Korea, Iran, and the U.S. abstained from signing the agreement, while representing hubs for ICTs, online infrastructure and cybersecurity resources, personnel and experience. Tech companies including Facebook, Microsoft, IBM, Google, and HP also signed alongside civil society organizations and technical experts. While the agreement does not include a call for specific legislation, it does advocate for the promotion of human rights on the internet, the allocation of unique responsibilities to the private sector, and the end of hacking between nations in peacetime.
