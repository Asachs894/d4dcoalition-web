In an attempt to increase transparency and enable academic investigation and research, [Twitter released data about accounts and content][link] that have been part of global disinformation campaigns since 2016. Included in the data are two accounts that had not been part of earlier releases, and are thought by Twitter to be state-backed. In total, information about 3,841 accounts connected to the IRA in Russia and 770 other accounts have been released to the public. However, [researchers found even more fake Twitter accounts][link2] that appear to be linked to the Russian government that were not identified by Twitterâ€™s search, promoting politically benign topics such as Taco Bell and Coachella.
