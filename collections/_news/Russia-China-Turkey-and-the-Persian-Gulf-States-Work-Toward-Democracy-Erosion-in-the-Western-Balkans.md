The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) released a [new report][link] that focuses on the role of foreign governments in undermining the relatively recent democratic norms in the states of the Western Balkans of Europe. The report details the efforts of neighboring autocracies like Russia and Turkey, which have long histories of involvement in the region, as well as newer players like China and Persian Gulf States. These governments have allied with local elites who share their goal of undermining liberal democracy in the region. The motives for upending Balkan democracy range from Russia wanting to prevent further NATO membership, to China attempting to secure more lucrative economic deals without oversight from local regulatory bodies.
