A vulnerability in [Google+ profiles opened user data to 438 applications][link] between 2015 and March 2018, when the problem was discovered as part of an internal audit. This data breach resulted from a flaw in an API that was created by the tech company to allow developers to access profile information about individuals who used their apps and had given permission to share their profile data. Internal memos, investigative journalism, and a [blog post][link2] shed light on Google's decision to not go public with the information when it originally discovered the problem. Increased security measures including the termination of the Google+ service occurred in hopes of rectifying the problem. CEO Sundar Pichai has agreed to testify before Congress on the breach in the near future.
