U.S. lawmakers want [a deeper investigation][link] into the reported investment of two startups developing technology used for Chinese facial recognition surveillance by U.S. public pension funds, universities, and foundations. As BuzzFeed News [initially reported][link 2], venture capital or private equity firms used funds, entrusted by US institutional investors, to invest in SenseTime and Megvii. The Chinese government is allegedly using technology developed by these companies to surveil its citizens, including in Xinjiang where Chinese authorities have detained Uighur Muslims  and other ethnic minorities in internment camps.
