The Social Sciences Research Council (SSRC) has [provided grants][link] to a dozen teams of academic researchers to conduct projects that will investigate the role of social media in spreading political news. In order to better conduct their studies, these research teams will gain unprecedented access to Facebook's internal-use, privacy-protected data in democratic states in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. This data will include tracking of URLs shared on the platform, as well as the network's library of political ads. Researchers will be expected to follow a rigorous standard of ethics to maintain the privacy of user data.
