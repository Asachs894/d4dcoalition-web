Location data collected by mobile service providers is used for many legitimate purposes, including emergency assistance, financial fraud protection and under a warrant in official investigations. This access to data, however, is also sold to other companies and resold repeatedly until it is accessible by actors for non-legitimate use. For a small fee, websites offer phone location services, [effectively allowing any person to track another by their phone][link]. Mobile providers have said that they were in the dark about this use of their location data, while members of U.S. Congress and the Federal Communications Commision have called for better regulation and renewed safeguarding of private information.
