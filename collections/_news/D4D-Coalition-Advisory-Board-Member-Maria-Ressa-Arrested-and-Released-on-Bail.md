D4D Advisory Board Member and award-winning journalist Maria Ressa was arrested on February 13 in connection with "cyber libel" charges against Rappler, the news site she leads. The timing of the arrest was also somewhat unusual, making it difficult to impossible to file for bail until the next morning. The arrest was widely condemned as politically motivated, stemming from online statements made in 2012 that are now charged under a cyber libel law that went into effect after the statements at issue were made. Rappler has done extensive reporting on extrajudicial killings in the Philippines under the Duterte administration. Of the thousands of reported extrajudicial killings, by policy only a handful have been investigated by the Department of Justice, resulting in an even fewer number of prosecutions. Although the National Bureau of Investigation had initially concluded that Ressa could not be charged because the article predated the law, that judgment was overturned by the Department of Justice on the grounds that the news article was updated with a punctuation change in 2014.
