Facebook has used monetary incentives to encourage teens and young adults to download [a third party app which allows the company to view all phone and internet activity that users engage in on their device,][/link] be it iOS or Android. Promising to pay potential participants more than $20 per month, the social media giant has asked them to download the VPN “Facebook Research” which allows the company full access to information on other applications and activities on the participant’s mobile phone, likely in order to gauge the company’s competition. Within 24 hours of the revelation of this story, Apple removed Facebook Research from its iOS app store and revoked its iOS developer’s license.
