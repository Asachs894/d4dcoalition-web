On March 26th, NDI, IRI, DAI and the International Research & Exchanges Board (IREX) hosted a Technology for Democracy Happy Hour at Facebook’s DC headquarters entitled,  “Bots, Trolls, and Fancy Bears: Improving Electoral Integrity in Ukraine’s Upcoming Election.” The event focused on learning about the electoral environment in advance of the March 31 presidential election, what the Ukraine teams from IRI and IREX were seeing online and what they were doing in response, and how Facebook was working on content moderation to improve the quality of information during the election.
