        <p>A Portland Communications <a href="https://portland-communications.com/pdf/How-Africa-Tweets-2018.pdf">survey of influencers shaping Twitter conversations on recent African elections</a> shows that Africa is not immune to fake news, the rise of bots, or external influence on elections. The survey finds that 53% of key influencers came from outside the country holding the election, with many influencers coming from outside the continent. The report also reveals that bots had a major presence in election discourse while politicians had comparatively minor influence on discussions. Details on specific countries are provided.</p>

New surveillance and hacking technologies have allowed governments to anonymously track, threaten, and publicly delegitimize opponents on a greater scale than ever before.

In a fast-growing number of countries, political parties and government agencies are using social media to manipulate domestic public opinion, often in response to threatening foreign interference and junk news. Since 2010, political parties and governments have spent over half a billion dollars developing and implementing these operations.</p>

        <p>The European Union <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-be-fined-5-billion-by-eu-in-android-case-1531903470">issued Google a record-breaking antitrust fine</a> of €4.34 billion ($5.06 billion) over Google’s deals with mobile phone makers and telecommunications operators. According to EU regulators, Google’s contracts with phone makers effectively force those companies to prioritize Google apps and services in exchange for Google providing its Android operating system for free. The fine represents a major step towards stronger government oversight of technology companies, at least in the EU.</p>

        <p>The parliament of Uganda temporarily <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/uganda-social-media-tax-stays-for-now/">maintained a controversial tax on social media use</a> despite widespread protests against it. President Museveni, who first introduced the law, has cited the spread of “gossip” as a key reason for its existence. Seen as an attempt at state censorship, the tax has led to a significant drop in social media use in addition to creating new economic burdens for the Ugandan people.</p>

Bot presence on Instagram continues to increase despite efforts by Facebook to curb the spread. The rise in Instagram bots is especially concerning since images and videos, uniquely difficult to track and identify, could play a larger role in coming elections.</p>

        <p>In light of episodes of ethnic violence in Myanmar, India and Sri Lanka, Facebook has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/technology/facebook-to-remove-misinformation-that-leads-to-violence.html">announced tighter restrictions on disinformation and misinformation</a> spread through its site and Instagram. The company will start effectively removing false information that might lead to physical harm. However, the policy does not apply to WhatsApp, which has been a major catalyst for recent violent incidents.</p>

        <p>A joint <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/spooksandspin/the-secret-players-behind-macedonias-fake-news-sites">investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP)</a> and partners reveals that Macedonia’s fake American news industry in Veles was launched by well-known Macedonian attorney Trajche Arsov, not by apolitical teens as previously reported. During the 2016 election, Arsov worked closely with several high-profile American partners to churn out over a hundred fake news websites on social media. Macedonian security agencies are now cooperating with law enforcement in the US and several other European countries to investigate possible ties between Arsov and the recently indicted Russian hackers.</p>

        <p>A bill that would require certain automated social media accounts to identify themselves as bots is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/style/how-to-regulate-bots.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftechnology&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=technology&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">currently moving through the California state legislature</a>. Many critics charge that the proposed law lacks specifics, that it is not constitutional, or that it will not effectively solve the problem of bot influence on voters. The bill, among the first of its kind, demonstrates the challenges that face lawmakers seeking legislative solutions to the surge of automated accounts.</p>

        <p>New findings reveal that Russian propagators of disinformation <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/07/12/628085238/russian-influence-campaign-sought-to-exploit-americans-trust-in-local-news">often posed as local news sources</a> to exploit the American public’s higher levels of trust for local news organizations. Many fake local news Twitter accounts did not actually post false information, opting instead to establish long-term credibility for when they needed to operationalize. These cases further confirm that the Russian-led disinformation campaign has been years in the making.</p>

The toolbox aims to create a shared vocabulary amongst policymakers, citizens, and academics. Part One includes a glossary defining “commonly used” and “frequently misunderstood” terms related to information disorder. Part Two attempts to map the thirteen sub-categories of the information disorder field in order to facilitate more strategic, targeted research and action.
