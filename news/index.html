Ressa and Rappler Holdings were formally indicted on November 29, 2018, on charges of tax evasion—the latest action by the Philippine government in attempting to thwart the work of Rappler’s journalists—and Ressa turned herself into authorities and posted bail this week.</p>

The D4D Coalition seeks to act as a force multiplier for organizations who advocate for more democracy-friendly technology platforms and policies by providing an opportunity for collaboration and mutual support within the democracy community. The Coalition also provides direct lines of communication with major technology platforms and is improving communication between the democracy community and the tech industry.</p>

        <p>With election day drawing nearer, disinformation efforts to influence voters increase. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/us/politics/2018-digital-misinformation-roundup.html?login=email&amp;auth=login-email">The New York Times published a “Roundup”</a> of disinformation-related coverage, its impact on the U.S. midterm elections, and its spread internationally. In response to suspicious pro-Saudi Arabian government tweets, Twitter suspended suspected bots that tweeted and re-tweeted identical talking points including “#unfollow_enemies_of_the_nation.” Twitter also released 11 million tweets believed to be from state-backed information operations originating in Russia and Iran. Facebook pages that appeared to be for Women’s Marches were found to originate in Bangladesh and sought to sell march-related merchandise.</p>

In total, information about 3,841 accounts connected to the IRA in Russia and 770 other accounts have been released to the public. However, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/russian-twitter-bots-coachella-taco-bell">researchers found even more fake Twitter accounts</a> that appear to be linked to the Russian government that were not identified by Twitter’s search, promoting politically benign topics such as Taco Bell and Coachella.</p>

        <p>Data &amp; Society published a report on “<a href="https://datasociety.net/output/weaponizing-the-digital-influence-machine/">Weaponizing the Digital Influence Machine: The Political Perils of Online Ad Tech</a>”. The paper further explains the relationship between politics, media, and ill-meaning actors. It lays out the tactics, technologies, and conditions that anti-democratic and politically-motivated actors use to weaponize digital advertising. The report finds that three main strategies are employed by actors who use the “Digital Influence Machine” to attempt to divide an opponent’s supporters, leverage behavioral science techniques to influence consumers, and mobilize those who support their views by threatening their identity, political or otherwise.</p>

        <p>In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/opinion/brazil-election-fake-news-whatsapp.html">New York Times op-ed</a>, researchers and fact checkers in Brazil called on WhatsApp to make changes to its system when they found that it was being widely used to spread disinformation in the runup to the national election. A poll found that 44 percent of Brazilians use WhatsApp to read political news, and a growing amount of misinformation and disinformation has been shared widely through the app, and the writers called on the company to restrict forwards, broadcasts and limit the size of new groups in Brazil during the election period. A Facebook subsidiary, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/whatsapp-bans-100-000-accounts-before-brazilian-electio-1829886723">WhatsApp later banned over 100,000 accounts</a> associated with sharing false stories, but did not take up the suggestions before the election on October 28th.</p>

        <p>Hundreds of members of the Myanmar military, posing as civilians and often using tactics modeled after those used by Russia, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html">used Facebook to spread disinformation about the Muslim Rohingya minority</a>. One of the largest forced human migration human history, over 700,000 people, is widely attributed to this type of anti-Rohingya propaganda and the violence it incited. Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, reported that the company found “clear and deliberate attempts to covertly spread propaganda that were directly linked to the Myanmar military.”</p>

        <p>Full Fact, a British fact-checking group, released a report entitled “<a href="https://fullfact.org/media/uploads/full_fact_tackling_misinformation_in_an_open_society.pdf">Tackling misinformation in an open society. How to respond to misinformation and disinformation when the cure risks being worse than the disease</a>.” The report explains that it is more realistic to build resilience against disinformation and misinformation in the UK than to eliminate it all together. In the paper, Full Fact sets out a framework for response to disinformation and misinformation that is proportionate and risk-based, and caution against taking action without thinking through the consequences and allowing time for further research into the harm caused by such campaigns.</p>

        <p>A vulnerability in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-exposed-user-data-feared-repercussions-of-disclosing-to-public-1539017194">Google+ profiles opened user data to 438 applications</a> between 2015 and March 2018, when the problem was discovered as part of an internal audit. This data breach resulted from a flaw in an API that was created by the tech company to allow developers to access profile information about individuals who used their apps and had given permission to share their profile data. Internal memos, investigative journalism, and a <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/project-strobe/?mod=article_inline">blog post</a> shed light on Google’s decision to not go public with the information when it originally discovered the problem. Increased security measures including the termination of the Google+ service occurred in hopes of rectifying the problem. CEO Sundar Pichai has agreed to testify before Congress on the breach in the near future.</p>

        <p>The Design 4 Democracy (D4D) Coalition was honored to be a part of the <a href="https://summit.g0v.tw/2018/">2018 g0v Summit, from October 5-7, 2018</a>.  The Summit provided an opportunity to share information about the Coalition with other groups sharing similar objectives, including the Global Tech Accountability Network, a new initiative arising out of the <a href="https://progressivevoicemyanmar.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Burmese-NGOs-to-Facebook-April-2018.pdf">#DearMark letter</a>, led by organizations in Myanmar.   Among the areas of collaboration discussed were the development of an open data standard on social media monitoring, together with a platform implementing the standard, for social media monitoring organizations to adapt to their own specific needs.  The use of shared tools and data standards provides an opportunity for social media monitoring groups to share data with like-minded, trusted partners in other countries, providing a more complete picture of hate speech or disinformation in a regional or global context.  In addition, the Summit provided an opportunity to connect with D4D partners, g0v and CoFacts, which is working with the Coalition to adapt the CoFacts fact-checking chatbot from LINE to FB Messenger and WhatsApp.</p>

Facebook products are highly popular in Africa, however, <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1206935/whatsapp-is-the-most-popular-messaging-app-in-africa/">WhatsApp is used by far more people</a> to communicate than Facebook, while the fact-checking service will not extend to WhatsApp.</p>

This decision requires fake profiles or bots to be labeled as artificial, in hopes that the consumers of content on the internet will be better informed regarding the source of the information they view. This legislation is groundbreaking, but some who study bots caution <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/poi3.184">against legislating without a thorough understanding</a> of the different types of bots and how they function.</p>

For a long time, the organization lacked enough Burmese speaking employees, as well as programs that can effectively detect hate speech in the language and systems to translate the text, among other limitations preventing an effective response. It has also recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-facebook/facebook-bans-myanmar-army-chief-others-in-unprecedented-move-idUSKCN1LC0R7">blocked the accounts of 18 users and 52 pages that are linked to Myanmar’s military</a>, further highlighting the country’s worsening relationship with the world’s largest social media network.</p>

Similar events are being held with NDI and FGV-DAPP participation in Brazil and Colombia throughout July and August.</p>

The fine represents a major step towards stronger government oversight of technology companies, at least in the EU.</p>

              Russian Disinformation Campaign Exploited Americans’ Stronger Trust in Local News

        <p>New findings reveal that Russian propagators of disinformation <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/07/12/628085238/russian-influence-campaign-sought-to-exploit-americans-trust-in-local-news">often posed as local news sources</a> to exploit the American public’s higher levels of trust for local news organizations. Many fake local news Twitter accounts did not actually post false information, opting instead to establish long-term credibility for when they needed to operationalize. These cases further confirm that the Russian-led disinformation campaign has been years in the making.</p>

Part One includes a glossary defining “commonly used” and “frequently misunderstood” terms related to information disorder. Part Two attempts to map the thirteen sub-categories of the information disorder field in order to facilitate more strategic, targeted research and action. Part Three includes downloadable high-resolution graphics created to help explain information disorder.</p>

The platform heavily features local news and sensational stories, while passing over other popular topics including the economy and healthcare. WeChat shows many of the same characteristics as misinformation in mainstream media, but also displays ways in which immigrant populations diverge from norms because of its blend of U.S. media and Chinese media practices. On the platform, conservative voices feature loudly, with both liberal and conservative users discussing the role of Chinese immigrants in politics and in the United States.</p>
