Through a program funded by Microsoft, NDI and IRI conducted assessments in New Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai aimed at informing the development of an India-specific version of the Cybersecurity Campaign Playbook. The Playbook, originally developed by Harvard’s Belfer Center and with a Global Edition co-developed with NDI and IRI, aims to provide political campaigns with simple, actionable methods to counter the growing cyber threat. From January 7 to 18, IRI and NDI met with elected and appointed representatives from major political parties, civil society organizations, think tanks, current and former government officials, legal experts and political consultants in India to inform the Playbook’s localization. The India edition of the Playbook will be released the first week of March in Delhi, ahead of the April general elections in India.
