              <p>In an open letter issued on February 11, 2019, organizations from across civil society urged Facebook to take meaningful action to improve the transparency of political advertising on the platform. Led by the Mozilla Foundation, a broad array of democracy and human rights groups, including members of the Design 4 Democracy (D4D) Coalition, co-signed <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/eu-misinformation/">the open letter</a>, and supported its call for specific, time-bound action in order to improve transparency of political advertisements on social media platforms in the context of the European Union elections.</p>

                <h3>UPDATE: Arrest of Advisory Board Member Maria Ressa</h3>
              </header>
              <p>On December 7, 2018, the D4D Coalition Advisory Board issued a <a href="https://d4dcoalition.org/news/D4D-Coalition-Advisory-Board-Stands-in-Solidarity-with-Fellow-Member-Maria-Ressa-and-Rappler.html">statement of solidarity</a> condemning the indictment of fellow Advisory Board member and Rappler CEO Maria Ressa. In light of Maria Ressa’s arrest on February 13, 2019, on charges of cyber libel, the Coalition reaffirms the solidarity expressed in that statement, and reiterates its condemnation of efforts by Philippine government to silence Rappler. The charges stem from a seven-year-old story that predates the enactment of the 2012 Cybercrime Prevention Act. The arrest follows a <a href="https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/84-documents/218088-document-arrest-warrant-maria-ressa-tax-caseD4D-Coalition-Advisory-Board-Stands-in-Solidarity-with-Fellow-Member-Maria-Ressa-and-Rappler.html">string of charges</a> leveled against Ressa by the Philippine government, which are part of a broader attempt to silence independent and critical voices in the country. For her work as a guardian in the war against truth, Ressa was named one of <a href="http://time.com/person-of-the-year-2018-the-guardians/">Time Magazine’s 2018 Persons of the Year</a> and was the 2018 recipient of the Committee to Protect Journalism’s Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award. Today the D4D Coalition echoes Ressa’s remarks upon accepting the award, “The time to fight for journalism . . . is now.”</p>

                <h3>Chinese Influence Detected during Taiwanese Elections</h3>
              </header>
              <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. Senators led by Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/18/chinas-interference-elections-succeeded-taiwan/?utm_term=.0d43700dd4d1">have written a letter to U.S. Secretary of State</a> Mike Pompeo asking for an investigation into “CCP attempts to erode democratic processes and norms around the world threaten U.S. partnerships and prosperity,” particularly in regards to Taiwan.  They suggest that organized social media campaigns targeted the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), its candidates and President Tsai Ing-wen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/22/world/asia/taiwan-elections-meddling.html">during local elections in November</a>. Observers in Taiwan and elsewhere have said that the Chinese government supported these opposition campaigns with different forms of computational propaganda, and the Senators’ letter suggested they find the allegations credible and want them investigated.</p>

                <h3>US Senate Releases Two Reports on Russian Interference in 2016 Elections</h3>
              </header>
              <p>The US Senate Intelligence Committee released two externally produced reports that provide further data on the 2016 national elections, including <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5631936-IRA-Report-17-Dec.html">one partly authored by D4D Advisory Board member Philip Howard, Director of the Oxford Internet Institute in collaboration with Graphika</a>, a data analytics firm, and a <a href="https://www.newknowledge.com/disinforeport">second by New Knowledge</a>, another company studying social media and disinformation. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/16/new-report-russian-disinformation-prepared-senate-shows-operations-scale-sweep/?utm_term=.c2c6afa30a86">The reports find much broader usage of social media accounts linked across platforms</a>, particularly targeting conservative voters and African Americans. Platforms such as Instagram and YouTube have received less attention in the media, but were also found to have been used by groups such as the Russian Internet Research Agency, while the researchers also suggested that social media platforms would need to share more data to fully understand the full scope of the campaigns. The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to release its own report on these issues in the near future.</p>

                <h3>International IDEA Collaborates with Electoral Tribunal to Support Digital Media Unit</h3>
              </header>
              <p>D4D network partner International IDEA has entered into a collaboration with the Electoral Tribunal of Panama in order to provide support to the newly created Digital Media Unit. The unit’s mandate is twofold. On one side, it is in charge of the online communication of the Tribunal in terms of Electoral information, providing a key line of information to the population through Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp with the key electoral information. On the other, the Digital Media Unit is spearheading the fight against disinformation, with a 24/7 monitoring of social media war room, supporting the Tribunal to detect electoral offenses, campaigns to raise awareness around the dangers of spreading disinformation and engagement with diverse stakeholders to protect the electoral integrity. The Unit has also been in charge of launching the country’s first Digital Ethics Pact, encouraging the population to make responsible use of social media during the electoral campaign. International IDEA support will continue until the elections in May 2019 and beyond, aiming to position the Unit as the leader in the fight against disinformation in Panama.</p>
