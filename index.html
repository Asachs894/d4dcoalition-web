                <h3>Gen Z-ers Could Be Leading Rise of Disinformation and Conspiracy Theories on Instagram</h3>
              </header>
              <p>As social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter finally begin to crack-down on the prevalence of false information, hate-speech, and conspiracy theories on their platforms, one company <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/instagram-is-the-internets-new-home-for-hate/585382/">remains largely disengaged</a> from enforcing the developing norms of responsible operations for such websites: Instagram has seen a spike in accounts propagating disinformation, army of them populated by a growing number of conservative and alt-right aligned teenagers of the so-called “Generation Z” cohort. These accounts utilize a combination of memes, pop-culture, and posts of videos from Infowars -a conspiracy-peddling website that is banned on Facebook, and Twitter.</p>

                <h3>Facebook Accidentally Reveals Hundreds of Millions of Personal Passwords to Staffers</h3>
              </header>
              <p>Facebook has confirmed that it <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qvy9k7/facebook-hundreds-of-millions-user-passwords-plaintext-data-leak">left hundreds of millions of its users’ passwords exposed</a> as plaintext in its internal system. While this only means that engineers employed by the company were able to see the characters that made up passwords, Facebook admitted in a statement that this was a critical oversight that it intends to correct. Other sites like GitHub and Twitter had committed similar errors in the past.</p>

                <h3>Facebook Accused of Lobbying Politicians to Repeal Data-Privacy Laws</h3>
              </header>
              <p>Leaked internal documents from Facebook show that the social media company has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/02/facebook-global-lobbying-campaign-against-data-privacy-laws-investment?CMP=share_btn_tw">engaged in a high-level lobbying campaign</a> with some of Europe’s most powerful politicians. The exposed memos describe a strategy through which company COO Sheryl Sandberg, a popularly known motivational speaker, used her influence and prestige to convince the political elite in European Union countries to repeal their extant information-privacy laws. Targeted politicians included former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, and former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny.</p>

                <h3>Facebook Makes it Harder to Post Political Ads in Ukraine in Lead up Elections</h3>
              </header>
              <p>Facebook has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/one-sheeters/ads-with-political-content-ukraine?__tn__=-UKH-R">announced a new policy</a> for its users in Ukraine, wherein they must register to promote political ad content on the social media platform. To register, individuals must provide valid identification and enroll in two-factor identification system, while also agreeing to let all of their political content posted to Facebook contain a label that reads “paid for by (organization name here).” This move is likely a way to safeguard against disinformation in the lead-up to national elections this year.</p>

              </header>
              <p>In an open letter issued on February 11, 2019, organizations from across civil society urged Facebook to take meaningful action to improve the transparency of political advertising on the platform. Led by the Mozilla Foundation, a broad array of democracy and human rights groups, including members of the Design 4 Democracy (D4D) Coalition, co-signed <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/eu-misinformation/">the open letter</a>, and supported its call for specific, time-bound action in order to improve transparency of political advertisements on social media platforms in the context of the European Union elections.</p>
