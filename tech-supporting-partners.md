    text: "Building on its long-standing presence in Silicon Valley and its work in the democracy community, the National Democratic Institute (NDI) is leading the initiative to organize the Coalition. NDI is supported in this effort by the International Republican Institute (IRI), as well as the organizations of many of the Advisory Board members. The Coalition is intended as a vehicle to help drive and amplify ongoing efforts of the broader democracy. Initial support for the Coalition has been provided to NDI as part of a grant from the National Endowment for Democracy to protect the integrity of information in elections; the Coalition has received additional initial support from Facebook and Twitter, and is in discussions with a variety of donor aid agencies, philanthropic foundations, and tech industry actors regarding partnership with the Coalition."
