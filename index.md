  title: Design for Democracy
---
The Design for Democracy Coalition is a global consortium of democracy and human rights organizations who rely on the internet to advocate for more just, democratic societies. We are organizations and advocates from a diverse collection of regions, political ideologies, and backgrounds, united in our shared commitment to a more open, inclusive and democratic world.

We have come together to share our experiences from around the world, identify opportunities to improve online communications, and to advocate for a more harmonious and conscientious relationship between the technology and democracy communities.  We believe democracy and human rights must be a design principle: one that technologists and data scientists build in from the start  and think about every step of the way.  By developing a forum for coordination and support, and by creating an institutional channel for communication between the democracy community and the tech industry, the Design for Democracy Coalition is working together to strengthen democracyâ€™s place in the 21st century.
