## Background and Overview
Recent history has shown that well-intentioned digital tools can be abused or subverted to undermine political processes and democratic institutions. This has led to increasing calls for improved communication between the democracy and technology communities to prevent the misuse of online platforms and to ensure that Internet companies and social media platforms “design for democracy.”

The Design for Democracy Coalition will be a multi-partisan, global grouping of key actors in the democracy community to better liaise and coordinate with tech companies and social media platforms on matters of shared concern. The initiative will draw on existing NDI relationships with political party internationals (global associations of parties based on ideologies), parliamentary monitoring organizations, civic tech partners, and global network of domestic election monitoring organizations.

The coalition will provide a conduit for on-the-ground insights about political and civic activities with which tech intersects, and serve to:

1. Surface and escalate politically sensitive issues relating to tech products and platforms
2. Provide additional political information or context in resolving urgent incidents
3. Provide a vehicle for more proactive conversations between the democracy community and tech companies on how to better “design for democracy”
4. Serve as a clearinghouse for information and learning on disinformation and help to inform the global research agenda on disinformation vulnerability and resilience
5. Serve as a vehicle to improve donor coordination for support to local partners

Funding to support Coalition activities will come from a mix of sources, including private sector support (from industry partners and others), as well as potential government sources. The Coalition aspires to ensure that funding is appropriately diversified.

## Coalition Membership and Structure
The Design for Democracy Coalition will be comprised of democracy stakeholders working in a variety of country contexts. We envision the Coalition functioning with a tiered membership structure, with the management of the network centered among leaders and managers of relevant networks, but with the ability to access a broad range of local democracy organizations. Relevant networks would include associations of citizen election monitoring organizations, political party networks, parliamentary associations, civic tech organizations, etc. While the priority would be on-the-ground reach and the ability to surface issues and test solutions in a variety of contexts, NDI envisions a few select academic partners included in the coalition to help maintain analytic rigor in coalition research projects and to ensure that coalition activities draw on academic research.

To optimize the Coalition's engagement across core subject matter domains, the organizational
structure will feature a collection of working groups that focus on specific areas of interest at the intersection of technology and democracy. Notionally, this approach would include discrete working groups on topics such as disinformation and computational propaganda threats; cybersecurity; and civic tech. Each working group will be chaired or co-chaired by Coalition member organizations with domain expertise.

##Coalition Activities
The Design for Democracy Coalition will encourage tech and social media platforms to internalize democracy as a design principle, and engage industry leaders in the following types of illustrative activities:
1. Create and sustain an institutional channel for surfacing, escalating, and expediting responses to incidents that threaten to undermine political or electoral processes around the world
2. Coordinate research, monitoring, and investigation of trends concerning the use or abuse of technology in efforts to impair or interfere with democracy
3. Build capacity to support increased information and media literacy, citizen education, and
stakeholder participation in efforts to promote cybersecurity and data stewardship, and protect against disinformation and computational propaganda threats in a variety of geopolitical contexts and languages
4. Create space and mechanisms for dialogue among tech stakeholders and democracy organizations, including by convening civil society organizations, technology companies, academics, journalists and others to better understand threats and advance solutions through
research, data sharing, policies and tools
5. Develop pathways for domestic organizations to collaborate, communicate and connect with
tech companies in country and regional contexts on matters of impacting democracy, citizen participation, and governance

## About NDI
The National Democratic Institute is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, nongovernmental organization working to support and strengthen democratic institutions worldwide through citizen participation, openness and accountability in government. With offices in 55 countries, as well as remote programs in many others, NDI has broad and deep relationships of trust and confidence with political actors around the globe. Working to strengthen political parties and the electoral process, NDI combines relationships with political elites with grassroots actors. NDI has maintained a continuous presence in Silicon Valley since 2013, in recognition of the impact of technological change on democratic development. It has been a
leader in the civic tech and open government movements, providing support to the Code for All global community and co-chairing, with the Congress of Chile, the legislative openness working group of the Open Government Partnership. NDI has extensive experience protecting partners against cybersecurity threats through risk assessment, training, tech tools, and relationships with cybersecurity firms. NDI is also a leading advocate for internet freedom, working with the Internet Governance Forum’s Internet Rights and Principles Coalition to create the Open Internet for Democracy Initiative.
